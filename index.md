## Synopsis

This training is intended for new users and/or individuals with limited experience with the R software.  
In this workshop participants will be introduced to the basic principles of using R including how to load data, calculate summary statistics, create graphs and visualizations, and write an R script to document and repeat these steps. 
Participants will also be introduced to R-based graphical user interface (GUI) programs that allow users to carry out more advanced analyses. 
We will focus more specifically on the program [Wallace](https://wallaceecomod.github.io/), which guides users in creating high quality species distribution models.
